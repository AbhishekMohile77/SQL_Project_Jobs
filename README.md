# Introduction
üìäDive into data job market! Focusing on data analyst and adata scientist roles, this project explores üåè top-paying jobs, in demand skills and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics üìà

# Backgroud
Driven by a quest to navigate the data job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining other work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from [Data Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1kX3CkHR-gusbZEKLymiZJddtDSWrhkPQ). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills for the year 2023.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries are:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for Data Scientists (or any other roles) ?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries ?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn ?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the databse and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job postings data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the job market. <br/>
All of the following graphs/charts and tables are generated using google collab after saving query outputs as .csv file. <br/>
Here are some of the analysis obtained:

## Total Number of Jobs Available
The first example of analysis focuses on the jobs posted over the whole year of 2023.

The insights came out as: <br/>
Data Analyst had the highest number of job postings, around 196K openings throughout 2023 followed by Data Engineer and Data Scientist as 186K and 172K openings, respectively with short difference margins.
